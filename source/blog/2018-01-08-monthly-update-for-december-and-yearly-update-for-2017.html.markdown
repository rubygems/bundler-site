Welcome to the Bundler monthly (and yearly) update! We've been writing monthly updates about Bundler for several years as part of the [Ruby Together monthly updates](https://rubytogether.org/news), and finally realized that we should be posting those monthly updates here, as well. Here's to many more monthly updates to come!

As you may have noticed, [Bundler didn’t end up shipping with Ruby 2.5](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/). The Ruby language core team has yet to announce why they decided to remove Bundler a few hours before Ruby 2.5 was released on Christmas Day. Hopefully, we’ll find out the story there soon.

In the meantime, Bundler 1.16.1 has been released, with fixes or workarounds for all known issues. If you were waiting to upgrade to version 1.16, give it a try now! If you’re still seeing issues on version 1.16.1, please [let us know!](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/new?labels=Bundler&template=bundler-related-issue.md) We care a lot about fixing bugs and maintaining backwards compatibility, but we need to hear from users in order to know when bugs have crept in. &lt;3

In December, Bundler gained 59 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 419 additions and 301 deletions across 36 files.

In 2017, Bundler gained two new maintainers, [Colby Swandale](https://twitter.com/0xcolby) and [hsbt](https://twitter.com/hsbt). We shipped 21 releases total, which included 3 feature releases. Those releases included 1,392 commits, by 31 authors, with 21,892 additions and 5,860 deletions across 1,140 changed files.
