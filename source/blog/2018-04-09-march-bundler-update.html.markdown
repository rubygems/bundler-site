Welcome to the Bundler monthly update! 

Bundler saw a variety of bug fixes in March thanks to our contributors, including [@alyssais](https://github.com/alyssais), [@koic](https://github.com/koic), [@MSP-Greg](https://github.com/MSP-Greg), [@nesaulov](https://github.com/nesaulov), [@kunruh9](https://github.com/kunruh9), [@shime](https://github.com/shime), and [@greysteil](https://github.com/greysteil). Fixes included [documenting the order Bundler loads config settings](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/pull/6464) as well as fixing some [rescue calls that hadn’t specified error type](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/pull/6310). Additionally, we published a [Bundler Policies](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/blob/2053d65c974f55fc15196b3ad82d7749750b2a3e/doc/POLICIES.md) doc to supplement Bundler’s existing Code of Conduct.

Coming up next, we expect to ship bug fixes, push out a small feature release, and begin public testing on Bundler 2.0. In total, Bundler gained 60 new commits, contributed by 13 authors. There were 353 additions and 97 deletions across 47 files.
