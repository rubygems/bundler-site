Welcome to the June Bundler update!

Last month, we fixed some bugs and our Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students finished work on the `bundle remove` feature. We also created a [checklist for the Bundler 2 release](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/issues/6582), and finished documentation for the [Bundler release process](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/pull/5252).

After that, we published a [public request for comments](https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/pull/12) on the idea of Bundler release channels. Just this week, we learned a lot about [how Docker and Bundler can work better together](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/pull/6524).

We published a new zine called ["The Evolution of Bundler"](https://shop.rubytogether.org/products/the-evolution-of-bundler-zine) in partnership with [@sailorhg](https://www.twitter.com/sailorhg) of Bubblesort Zines. It's now available for sale in the Ruby Together store.

This month, Bundler gained 63 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 738 additions and 102 deletions across 48 files.
