Welcome to the September monthly update!

The Bundler team merged 29 pull requests, including fixes for nested `bundle exec`, various bugs around choosing and updating gem versions, documentation improvements, and full compatibility with TruffleRuby. We also released versions 1.16.5 and 1.17.0.pre.

We also decided how to drop backwards compatibility with old Ruby versions, allowing us to resume work to merge Bundler into Ruby 2.6. We may or may not complete everything in time for the Ruby 2.6 release at Christmas, but we're still working towards it!

In September, Bundler gained 73 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 419 additions and 151 deletions across 40 files.
