Welcome to the October monthly update!

We released [Bundler 1.17](https://bundler.io/blog/2018/10/25/announcing-bundler-1-17-0.html), which ships a new `remove` command (for removing gems from the command line), new command options, new events for Bundler plugins, and new environment variables. For a complete list of changes, check out the [v1.17 release notes](https://bundler.io/v1.17/whats_new.html).

We also announced our [new plan for Bundler 2.0](https://bundler.io/blog/2018/11/04/an-update-on-bundler-2.html), a new approach that we think the Bundler team and Bundler users will both be excited about. We're planning to write more blog posts and documentation about Bundler 2, and push a prerelease preview for interested beta testers in the next week or two.

This month, Bundler gained 107 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 473 additions and 156 deletions across 35 files.
