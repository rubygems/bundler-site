Welcome to the November monthly update!

This month, we [announced the upcoming Bundler 2.0 release](https://bundler.io/blog/2018/11/04/an-update-on-bundler-2.html) and shipped a few prerelease versions. As mentioned in the blog post, Bundler 2 will drop support for Ruby versions that are no longer supported by the Ruby core team.

If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even try the Bundler 2 prerelease by running `gem install bundler --pre`. (You can even use the Bundler 2 prerelease on Heroku, with the [Bundler 2 buildpack](https://github.com/bundler/heroku-buildpack-bundler2)!).

For the less adventurous, we’re writing documentation furiously, and we will post a full Bundler 2 upgrade guide along with the final 2.0.0 release. 

This month, Bundler gained 44 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 331 additions and 150 deletions across 51 files.
