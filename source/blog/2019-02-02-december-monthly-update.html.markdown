Welcome to the December 2018 monthly update!

In December, Bundler reached two huge and exciting milestones. First, Ruby included Bundler for the first time ever, including Bundler 1.17.2 in Ruby 2.6. Special thanks are due to [@hsbt](https://github.com/hsbt) for years worth of work integrating Bundler into the ruby-core test suite and keeping everything working and up to date.

Second, Bundler [shipped version 2.0](https://bundler.io/blog/2019/01/03/announcing-bundler-2.html)! It’s a big milestone, and the Bundler team is very excited to adopt a yearly major release cadence, to better match Ruby itself.

Bundler gained 55 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 225 additions and 63 deletions across 21 files.
