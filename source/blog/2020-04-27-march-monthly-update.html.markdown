Welcome to the Bundler monthly update! As part of our efforts at [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org), we publish a recap of the work that we've done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to Bundler in March.

Amazingly, all that work that the entire Bundler and RubyGems teams have been working at for years has paid off in a really big way: Bundler and RubyGems have merged repositories! On GitHub, `bundler/bundler` is archived, and all ongoing work on both projects now takes place inside `RubyGems/RubyGems`. All other repositories from the Bundler organization have either been archived (if unused) or moved to the RubyGems organization.

Not just the repositories have changed, either: the Bundler and RubyGems teams have merged as well. Itâ€™ll take us some time to work through 20 years worth of documentation and webpages, but weâ€™ll be combining and updating them as fast as we can.

From this point forward, Bundler news will be reported together with RubyGems news. Hooray! ðŸŽ‰
