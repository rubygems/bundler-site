%h2 Bundler compatibility with Ruby & RubyGems

%p.contents
  The latest Bundler release should always support, at the very least, all
  rubies that have not yet reached their End of Life date.

%p.contents
  The latest Bundler release should always support all RubyGems versions higher
  than or equal to the one shipped with the oldest Ruby version supported.
  RubyGems is not allowed to be downgraded further than that, so upgrading or
  downgrading RubyGems should not affect Bundler.

%p.contents
  That effectively comes down to the following:

.contents
  .bullet
    .description

        %li requires a minimum ruby version of <b>2.6.0</b>, and a minimum RubyGems version of <b>3.0.1</b> (version of RubyGems shipped with ruby <b>2.6.0</b>).
