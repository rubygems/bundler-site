* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
