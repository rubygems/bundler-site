Bundler's dependency resolver is now powered by Molinillo, the CocoaPods dependency resolution algorithm sponsored by Stripe that is fully
documented, tested, and built for use across different dependency managers built in Ruby.

### Improved gemspec detection

Directories are now searched resursively for gemspecs, with specs found closer to the root being preferred.

### Other changes

Bundler 1.9 also includes:

- improved vendoring of `thor` that will make conflicts less common
- fixed gemspecs generated by `bundle gem` from a pre-release bundler version
- `bundle which` will no longer be confused by directories
