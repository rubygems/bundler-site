## How to use Bundler with RubyMotion

If you don't have a RubyMotion app yet, generate one.

~~~
$ motion create myapp
$ cd myapp
~~~

You'll need to create a Gemfile. Here we're using bubblewrap.

~~~ruby
gem 'bubble-wrap'
~~~

Then, set up your Rakefile to require your bundled gems at compile time.
Add this to the top of the file, right beneath the line `require 'motion/project'`

~~~ruby
require 'bundler'
Bundler.require
~~~

Next, install your dependencies:

~~~
$ bundle install
~~~

Now you can just compile your app as normal.

~~~
$ bundle exec rake
~~~
