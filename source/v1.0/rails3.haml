      If you want a dependency to be loaded only in
      a certain Rails environment, place it in a group
      named after that Rails environment
    :code
      # lang: ruby
      group :test do
        gem "rspec"
        gem "faker"
      end

      You can place a dependency in multiple groups
      at once as well
    :code
      # lang: ruby
      group :development, :test do
        gem "wirble"
        gem "ruby-debug"
      end

      After adding a dependency, if it is not yet
      installed, install it
    .how
      :code
        $ bundle install
      .notes
        This will update all dependencies in your
        Gemfile to the latest versions that do not
        conflict with other dependencies
