.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Bundler 1.3 is compatible with Ruby 2.0.0 and Rubygems 2.0.0. The way of the future!

%h2#rails-4 Compatible with Rails 4

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Bundler 1.3 provides the `binstubs` command, which is used by Rails 4 to create executables that will run inside the context of your Rails app. For example, `bundle binstubs rspec-core` will create `bin/rspec` that you can run directly without needing `bundle exec`.

%h2#resolver Install and update speed improvements

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Installing a Gemfile with no lock or running `bundle update` used to be extremely slow in certain cases. In our testing, all of those cases now complete within a few seconds. In some cases, the install or update completes 150 times faster!


%h2#signing Support for signed gems

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Bundler now supports signed gems! `bundle install --trust-policy` takes the same arguments as `gem install --trust-policy` does.
