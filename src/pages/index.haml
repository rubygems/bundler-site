  Bundler manages an <strong>application's dependencies</strong> through its
  entire life across many machines systematically and repeatably.

%h2 Checking Out an Application With a Gemfile

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Install the required gems
    :highlight_plain
      $ bundle install
    = link("Learn More: bundle install", "bundle_install.html")

%h2 Digging Further

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Store all of the required gems in your
      application. All future installs will get gems
      from this cache, bypassing rubygems.org
    :highlight_plain
      $ bundle package
    = link("Learn More: bundle package", "bundle_package.html")

  .bullet
    .description
      Put dependencies in a group, so they can
      be ignored at install time or required
      together in your application
    :highlight_ruby
      group :development do
        gem "wirble"
      end
    = link("Learn more: Groups", "groups.html")

  .bullet
    .description
      Use a gem that is stored in git
      and has a .gemspec at its root. Gemspecs with
      bins or C extensions are supported
    :highlight_ruby
      gem "nokogiri", :git =>
        "git://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri.git"
    = link("Learn more: Git", "git.html")

  .bullet
    .description
      Use a gem that you are actively developing
      on your file system
    :highlight_ruby
      gem "nokogiri", :path => "~/Code/nokogiri"

  .bullet
    .description
      Install gems to a different location
      (the default is ~/.bundle)
    .how
      :highlight_plain
        $ bundle install vendor --disable-shared-gems
      .notes
        By specifying --disable-shared-gems, you are telling
        bundler to install the gems into vendor, even if
        they are already installed in the system
